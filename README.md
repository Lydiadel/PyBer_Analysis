## Overview
Performance exploratory analysis on a Python based ride-sharing data company called **Pyber**, working with **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Numpy** and **Jupyter Notebook** to build several types of visualizations to improve **Pyber** access to ride-sharing services.

## Results
### Output City Types

#### Summary
In this DataFrame show the difference between the three types of cities which are **Rural, Urban** and **Suburban**. There is a contrast between the **Urban cities** and **Rural cities** with a difference of 1500 total drives winning **Urban Type** and the **Suburban** is a point a little below in the middle of the other types. The *total drivers* is really denotative since **Urban** has the most total drivers with a total of **2405 drivers** leaving **Suburban** and **Rural** with a few but between this two **Suburban** is higher. The *fare average per ride* and *average fare per driver* is higher for **Rural type** but it doesn't mean that is a good thing, the service they bring isn't affordable at all specially in **Rural type** and **Suburban type**. The best type of cities performance on ride-sharing was the **Urban type** because is cost-effective, there are enough drivers and the total fare is the highest.

#### Summary
For the **Rural cities type** it would be a good idea to increment drivers the last week of *February* and the first week of *April* because of the demand of drivers, **Suburban cities type** had the highest Fare($USD) one week before *March* and by the end of *April*, finally the **Urban cities type** were on the top the last week of *February* and first week of *March* having the most **Total Fare ($USD)** of the three **city types** mentioned before.

## Business recommendations to the CEO 
- Improve the drivers in rural cities, since the lack of drivers affects the total rides along with the total fares final and averages.
- Decrease the price in rural and suburban cities so the number of rides could improve due the fact that people could afford more rides and taking in consideration the incomes in the rural cities type.
- Follow the tendencies and see when more demand is, the line chart is a tool that shows when **Total Fare ($USD)** is on the peak for each **city type**, this is helpful to know when to increment the total drivers related to the high demand of them.
